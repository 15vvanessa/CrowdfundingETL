# CrowdfundingETL

Given multiple excel files of crowdfunding and backer contact data in string format, the ETL project will read in these files and create dataframes with the cleaned formatted data. The data is then exported and loaded in to a PostgreSQL database. The schema and entity relationship diagram for this database are provided in this repo.

This project was completed with a group of classmates.
